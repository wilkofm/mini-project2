PS5 Game Explorer

# Project Outline

What Do I Want To Make?

A video game database, specifically based on Playstation 5 games. My PS5 game explorer is a one-page site where the user receives a card list of Playstation games with information such as genre, release year and metacritic score, with the ability to filter by those categories. When clicking on the cards, the user will also receive a description of the video game in a pop up window.

# Github

How many branches and what for?

Main Branch

- This is my production-ready branch. It should always contain stable, tested code

Card List Branch
- Where I set up my Vite project and the initial card list that pulls the list of games from my API

Filter Branch
- Branch where I create the ability to filter each game based on the movie genre, year or metacritic rating

Card List Styling Branch
- Branch where I set up Tailwind CSS and begin my initial styling on the page, making sure the card list is formatted correctly

Description Popup Branch
- This is where I implement the ability to receive a description when clicking on the game card
  
Dark Mode Feature
- This is where I implement the ability to switch to dark mode and change the theme of the page
  
Mobile Friendly Styling Branch

- This is the brand where I finalize styling and ensure the page is mobile-friendly
  
# Styling Goals

I want the site to match the feel of Playstation network app/site

Here are a few styling features I’d like to implement:

- Tailwind CSS to style the page
- Clean layout
- A Logo
- Icons
- A nav-bar to house the filter options
- Resizing card/images so everything is uniform

How To Implement This Project Yourself

* Import the files within this GitHub project into your development environment
